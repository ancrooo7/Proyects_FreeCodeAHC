                    <li><p><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after thePearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab towork on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and otherapplied science.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and PlantPathology.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plantpathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 differentstrains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for eachmajor climate on Earth.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice eachseason, doubling wheat yields.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheatwith a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well tofertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yieldingstrains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate massstarvation due to a rapidly expanding population.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize.</p></li>

                    <li><p><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world foodsupply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way wecan meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are notinherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants andanimals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people wereselecting the best breeds.".</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</p></li>
